# README

This repo contains two code examples:

- [`failing-esm-example`](/failing-esm-example/)
- [`succeeding-yarn-example`](./succeeding-yarn-example/)

In both code examples a WGS84 coordinate is transformed to `EPSG:28992`, but  [`failing-esm-example`](/failing-esm-example/) is not working; both coordinate-pairs should be converterd to `EPSG:28992`, which is not the case for the coordinate-pair which has been converted by openlayers. 

See the `README`'s in the respective directories for instructions on how to get the example up and running.
